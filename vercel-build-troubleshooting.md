# Vercel Build Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Build Issues & Solutions

### 1. TypeScript/ESLint Errors
- **Fixed**: We already resolved the unused variable warnings
- **Status**: ✅ Should pass now

### 2. Environment Variables Missing
- **Issue**: Missing required environment variables
- **Solution**: Add to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
- **Required**:
  - `DATABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
  - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

### 3. Database Connection Issues
- **Issue**: Prisma can't connect to database during build
- **Solution**: 
  - Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set
  - Use `prisma generate` in build process
  - Database doesn't need to be accessible during build (only runtime)

### 4. Memory/Timeout Issues  
- **Issue**: Build exceeds time/memory limits
- **Solution**: Vercel Pro has higher limits if needed

### 5. Dependency Issues
- **Current**: 1 moderate vulnerability detected
- **Action**: Run `npm audit fix` after deployment
- **Impact**: Won't block deployment

## Build Success Indicators

- ✅ Pages generated successfully  
- ✅ Build completed without errors

## Next Steps After Successful Build
1. Test the deployed application
2. Configure environment variables if not done
3. Run database migrations
4. Test authentication flow
5. Verify all features work in production
